# Kasilink Labs

This is my learning repo where I practice **Python** and gradually apply it to building Kasilink.  
The goal is to learn from scratch, keep track of progress, and connect each step to real project ideas.

## Structure
- `week1/` → Python basics (exercises + notes)
- `week2/` → Flask basics and simple APIs
- `week3/` → Database + API integration
- `week4/` → Kasilink prototypes (connecting everything together)

## Build Log
I’m keeping a daily log in [`BUILD_LOG.md`](./BUILD_LOG.md) with commits and reflections.

## Goals
- Build strong Python fundamentals  
- Practice daily with small exercises  
- Apply what I learn directly to Kasilink  
- Keep everything documented for future reference
