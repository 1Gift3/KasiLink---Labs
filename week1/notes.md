I started with Kasilab - which i am revising Py4e with kasilink in mind excercises. The thing is ive been learning and stopping when i get to big bugs or a negative mental attitude.

So with changing that since mental change that it is God that has given me this so what so ever i come accross i will persist and concourer because it is mine for the taking.
